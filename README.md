###  Data Acquisition & Preparation
- Collected raw transactional data: `orders.csv` and `products.csv`
- Parsed date fields and merged datasets in Python
- Used `pandas` to structure data by time, product, and geography

###  Dashboard Development (Power BI)
  - Total Orders, Revenue, AOV
  - City-wise and Category-wise summaries
  - Customer loyalty analysis: One-Time vs Repeat
  - Forecasting for order trends (Analytics pane)

 **File**: `Customer Behaviour Dashboard.pbix`

 - Integrated with slicers for real-time filtering

###  Weekly Reporting Automation (Python)
- Created `weekly_report.py` to:
  - Filter last 7 days of sales
  - Aggregate city revenue and top-selling products
  - Export an Excel file with timestamped filenames

 Output Sample: `Weekly_Sales_Report_20250729_2315`

###  Task Scheduler Integration 
- Created a scheduled task to auto-run the script weekly

##  How to Run

### Power BI Dashboard
1. Open `Customer Behaviour Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop
2. Use slicers to filter by:
   - City
   - Customer Type (Repeat / One-Time)
   - Category

### Python Script
1. Ensure `orders.csv` and `products.csv` are in the same folder
2. Run the script from terminal:
   ```
   python weekly_report.py
   ```
3. Output Excel file will be generated with a timestamped name.
