Hi Team,



I just analysed the past 30 days orders and here 

are my findings as follows:



* Total orders from Chennai are least but the AOV is most; indicating high value orders are made in Chennai
* Hyderabad is lacking total orders made and in turn least revenue generated from here, AOV is also the least here.
* Good revenue output and decent total orders shown from Kolkata.



In accordance with my analysis output, here are my recommendations:



* We should encourage Chennai's customers to order more to improve the count of orders made
* Hyderabad is really the point of concern, we should run some campaign here to engage customers more in purchasing from us.
* Aside Hyderabad next we should focus on Delhi and Mumbai, for now they are not alarming but still they are falling behind



Warm Regards,
