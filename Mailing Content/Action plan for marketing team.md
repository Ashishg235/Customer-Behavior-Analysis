* More than half of our customers are not making more purchase after their first order. I believe we are lacking in customer satisfaction or customer engagement.
* Customer retention need to be improved, we have decent percentage or repeated customers but it's still can be improved.
* We should start engaging customers by providing rewards for their continuous purchases or showcasing them more the products they are interested in by running email, and also we can take feedback from customers after their order is successful for understanding better to improve retention.
